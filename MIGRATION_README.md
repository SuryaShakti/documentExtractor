- **Database Integration**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **File Upload Handling**: Cloudinary integration with proper validation
- **Middleware**: Authentication, authorization, error handling, rate limiting
- **Validation**: Zod-based request/response validation

### ✅ Improved Architecture
- **Single Server**: No more separate frontend/backend servers
- **No CORS Issues**: Frontend and API on the same domain
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Better Performance**: Reduced latency and complexity
- **Simplified Deployment**: One build, one deployment

## 🛠️ How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup
The `.env.local` file has been updated with all necessary variables:
```env
# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
JWT_EXPIRE=7d

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=...

# Admin
ADMIN_EMAIL=suryashakti1999@gmail.com

# File Upload
MAX_FILE_SIZE=52428800
MAX_FILES_PER_UPLOAD=10

# Frontend
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api
```

## 🔄 Migration Benefits

### Before (Express.js + Next.js)
❌ Two separate servers to manage  
❌ CORS configuration issues  
❌ Complex deployment process  
❌ Port conflicts  
❌ Development workflow complexity  

### After (Next.js Full Stack)
✅ Single server application  
✅ No CORS issues  
✅ Simplified deployment  
✅ Better performance  
✅ Easier development  
✅ Better type safety  

## 🚀 Deployment

Since everything is now in Next.js, you can deploy to:

- **Vercel** (Recommended for Next.js)
- **Netlify**
- **AWS Amplify**
- **Docker containers**
- **Traditional hosting**

Just run:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🧪 Testing the Migration

### 1. Test Authentication
```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123","firstName":"Test","lastName":"User"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123"}'
```

### 2. Test Project Creation
```bash
# Create a project (use token from login)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Project","description":"Testing migration"}'
```

### 3. Test File Upload
Use the frontend interface to test file uploads - the upload functionality now works seamlessly with the integrated backend.

## 🔍 Backward Compatibility

The legacy `/api/documents` endpoint has been maintained for backward compatibility with existing frontend components. It now intelligently:

1. **Tries database first**: Gets data from MongoDB if available
2. **Falls back to file**: Uses the old JSON file system as fallback
3. **Maintains API contract**: Same request/response format

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Remove old backend folder**: `rm -rf backend/` (after testing)
2. **Update frontend API calls**: Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` from `http://localhost:5000/api/v1` to `/api`
3. **Test all functionality**: Ensure everything works as expected
4. **Deploy**: Your app is now ready for seamless deployment!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Module not found errors**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Database connection issues**
   - Check `MONGODB_URI` in `.env.local`
   - Ensure MongoDB Atlas allows connections

3. **File upload issues**
   - Verify Cloudinary credentials
   - Check file size limits

4. **Authentication errors**
   - Verify `JWT_SECRET` is set
   - Check token expiration

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Check that MongoDB connection is working

Your document extractor is now a modern, full-stack Next.js application! 🎉
